    <h2><font face="Arial"color="red">What is Global Warming?</font><div id= what></h2>
  <p> Global warming is a long-term increase in the overall average temperature on earth, caused by the greenhouse effect. It is one aspect of climate change.
    In line with the global trend, Hong Kong has been warming up in the last century or so. The number of hot nights is increasing while the number of cold days is decreasing.</p>

<h2><font face="Arial" color="red">Cause and effect</font><div id= causeandeffect></h2>
  <p>Global warming is mainly caused by when carbon dioxide and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere,
  and they absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earths surface. This causes the earth's temperature to get hotter,
  and this is known as the "greenhouse effect". Some other causes are burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and agriculture.
  The effects of this is it causes the average temperature rise and worsen air quality and it can cause more typhoons.
  Global warming affects all living creatures, which include plants, animals and humans. It affects our daily life because it worsens our health.
  It affects Hong Kong because there is going to be more typhoons, heavier and more frequent rain, longer summer and shorter winter, higher humidity and flood in low-lying areas, and the sea levels are rising in the victoria harbour.
  For animals, it might destroy animal homes like glaciers, and can directly affect their lifestyle and animals might not have homes, which might even lead to extinction. </p>

  <h2><font face="Arial"color="red">Why and how to prevent global warming?</font><div id= prevent></h2>
 <p> It is important to prevent global warming because it can affect the lives of all living creatures, and it is also causing other serious problems such as sea levels rising, rising average temperature and arctic ice melting.
   In Hong Kong, Global warming can cause typhoons and rise average temperature, which is not good for the climate here, so it is very important to prevent this problem.
   We can do some simple things that can make a difference and help prevent global warming, which include reducing water waste, using fuel-efficient and energy-efficient products, save energy, prevent wasting food etc..
    We can also try using more renewable energy sources, such as solar panels which produce solar energy and more.</p>
